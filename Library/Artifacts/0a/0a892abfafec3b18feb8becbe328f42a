search results in File Explorer will be affected. MAPI items reside in the Internet zone, so disabling this policy for the Internet zone will prevent the previewing of these items in File Explorer. For the case of custom thumbnails, it is the zone of the thumbnail that is checked, not the zone of item.  Typically these are the same but a source is able to define a specific location of a thumbnail that is different than the location of the item.

If you enable this policy setting, users can preview items and get custom thumbnails from OpenSearch query results in this zone using File Explorer.

If you disable this policy setting, users will be prevented from previewing items and get custom thumbnails from OpenSearch query results in this zone using File Explorer.

If you do not configure this policy setting, users cannot preview items or get custom thumbnails from OpenSearch query results in this zone using File Explorer.

Changes to this setting may not be applied until the user logs off from Windows.

This policy setting allows you to specify a location where all default Library definition files for users/machines reside.

If you enable this policy setting, administrators can specify a path where all default Library definition files for users reside. The user will not be allowed to make changes to these Libraries from the UI. On every logon, the policy settings are verified and Libraries for the user are updated or changed according to the path defined.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, no changes are made to the location of the default Library definition files.

      <string id="SmartScreen_Warn">Warn</string>
      <string id="EnableSmartScreen_Help">This policy allows you to turn Windows Defender SmartScreen on or off.  SmartScreen helps protect PCs by warning users before running potentially malicious programs downloaded from the Internet.  This warning is presented as an interstitial dialog shown before running an app that has been downloaded from the Internet and is unrecognized or known to be malicious.  No dialog is shown for apps that do not appear to be suspicious.

Some information is sent to Microsoft about files and programs run on PCs with this feature enabled.

If you enable this policy, SmartScreen will be turned on for all users.  Its behavior can be controlled by the following options:

• Warn and prevent bypass
• Warn

If you enable this policy with the "Warn and prevent bypass" option, SmartScreen's dialogs will not present the user with the option to disregard the warning and run the app.  SmartScreen will continue to show the warning on subsequent attempts to run the app.

If you enable this policy with the "Warn" option, SmartScreen's dialogs will warn the user that the app appears suspicious, but will permit the user to disregard the warning and run the app anyway.  SmartScreen will not warn the user again for that app if the user tells SmartScreen to run the app.

If you disable this policy, SmartScreen will be turned off for all users.  Users will not be warned if they try to run suspicious apps from the Internet.

If you do not configure this policy, SmartScreen will be enabled by default, but users may change their settings.
