e the file.

	   Also beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use -c on a file which is of
	   equal size as the one on the server, Wget will refuse to download
	   the file and print an explanatory message.  The same happens when
	   the file is smaller on the server than locally (presumably because
	   it was changed on the server since your last download
	   attempt)---because "continuing" is not meaningful, no download
	   occurs.

	   On the other side of the coin, while using -c, any file that's
	   bigger on the server than locally will be considered an incomplete
	   download and only "(length(remote) - length(local))" bytes will be
	   downloaded and tacked onto the end of the local file.  This
	   behavior can be desirable in certain cases---for instance, you can
	   use wget -c to download just the new portion that's been appended
	   to a data collection or log file.

	   However, if the file is bigger on the server because it's been
	   changed, as opposed to just appended to, you'll end up with a
	   garbled file.  Wget has no way of verifying that the local file is
	   really a valid prefix of the remote file.  You need to be
	   especially careful of this when using -c in conjunction with -r,
	   since every file will be considered as an "incomplete download"
	   candidate.

	   Another instance where you'll get a garbled file if you try to use
	   -c is if you have a lame HTTP proxy that inserts a "transfer
	   interrupted" string into the local file.  In the future a
	   "rollback" option may be added to deal with this case.

	   Note that -c only works with FTP servers and with HTTP servers that
	   support the "Range" header.

       --progress=type
	   Select the type of the progress indicator you wish to use.  Legal
	   indicators are "dot" and "bar".

	   The "bar" indicator is used by default.  It draws an ASCII progress
	   bar graphics (a.k.a "thermometer" display) indicating the status of
	   retrieval.  If the output is not a TTY, the "dot" bar will be used
	   by default.

	   Use --progress=dot to switch to the "dot" display.  It traces the
	   retrieval by printing dots on the screen, each dot representing a
	   fixed amount of downloaded data.

	   When using the dotted retrieval, you may also set the style by
	   specifying the type as dot:style.  Different styles assign
	   different meanin
